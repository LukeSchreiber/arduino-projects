# Arduino Reaction Timer Game 🎮

A simple reaction time tester built with an **Arduino Uno**, **pushbutton**, **LED**, and an **LCD1602 display**.  
The game measures how fast you can react to a random LED signal, then shows your **result, average, and best time** for each 3-trial round.

## 🔧 Features
- **Triple-press start**: Press the button 3 times quickly to start a new round.  
- **3 trials per round**: Each trial waits a random 1.5–4 seconds before lighting the LED.  
- **Reaction measurement**: Press as soon as the LED lights up to record your time in ms.  
- **Per-round stats**: LCD shows your **average** and **best** of the 3 trials.  
- **False start detection**: If you press before the LED, the trial restarts.

### LCD1602 (parallel, 4-bit mode)
| LCD Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------|-------------|
| VSS     | GND         |
| VDD     | 5V          |
| VO      | Pot middle (other legs → 5V, GND) |
| RS      | D12         |
| RW      | GND         |
| E       | D11         |
| D4      | D5          |
| D5      | D4          |
| D6      | D3          |
| D7      | D6          |
| A       | 5V (backlight anode) |
| K       | GND (backlight cathode) |

### Button
- One leg → **D2**
- Opposite leg → **GND**

### LED
- Long leg (anode) → **D8** through 220 Ω resistor
- Short leg (cathode) → **GND**

## ▶️ How to Play
1. Upload `reaction-timer.ino` to your Arduino.  
2. Power it on — LCD will say *"Triple-press to go"*.  
3. Press the button 3 times quickly to start.  
4. Wait for the LED to turn on, then press ASAP!  
5. Repeat for 3 trials.  
6. LCD shows **your time each trial**, then **average + best** for the round.  
7. Triple-press again to restart a new round.
