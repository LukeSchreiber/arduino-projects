# Arduino Reaction Timer Game üéÆ

A simple reaction time tester built with an **Arduino Uno**, **pushbutton**, **LED**, and an **LCD1602 display**.  
The game measures how fast you can react to a random LED signal, then shows your **result, average, and best time** for each 3-trial round.

---

## üîß Features
- **Triple-press start**: Press the button 3 times quickly to start a new round.  
- **3 trials per round**: Each trial waits a random 1.5‚Äì4 seconds before lighting the LED.  
- **Reaction measurement**: Press as soon as the LED lights up to record your time in ms.  
- **Per-round stats**: LCD shows your **average** and **best** of the 3 trials.  
- **False start detection**: If you press before the LED, the trial restarts.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play
1. Upload `reaction-timer.ino` to your Arduino.  
2. Power it on ‚Äî LCD will say *"Triple-press to go"*.  
3. Press the button 3 times quickly to start.  
4. Wait for the LED to turn on, then press ASAP!  
5. Repeat for 3 trials.  
6. LCD shows **your time each trial**, then **average + best** for the round.  
7. Triple-press again to restart a new round.
